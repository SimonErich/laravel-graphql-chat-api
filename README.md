## Installation

To start a new project based on this repository, you should do a fork of it. So for the following, you will have to replace the repository url `git@github.com:tjventurini/laravel-blueprint.git` with your own.

To install this blueprint you need to clone this repository.

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:tjventurini/laravel-blueprint.git
```

Next you will need to checkout the branch related to the laravel version you want to use.

```
# default is 8.x
git checkout 8.x
```

If you have not forked this project yet, but are still using this project as a starting point for your own, you should rename the current remote `origin` from git to `blueprint` and add your own.

```
git remote rename origin blueprint # rename the source
git add origin <your-git-repo-reference> # add your own as origin
git push --set-upstream origin master # make sure you push to the right one
```

Note: This is important to keep the git-history in tact and to make things upgrade able against this project. See the upgrade section of this document or checkout the documentation.

Then you should go ahead and update the laradock configuration in your project in `.env.docker.example`. Make sure to update the `DATA_PATH_HOST` and `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` environment variables. Also you will have to set the `UID`s and `GID`s that match your host systems. You can find them out by running `id -a`.

Also make sure to update the `Makefile` of this project. You might need to update the `CONTAINERS` variable at the top of the file to specify the list of containers that you want to start for your project.

```
########################################
# variables
CONTAINERS=nginx php-fpm mysql workspace
```

Now you are ready to execute the setup from the make file.

```
make init
```

This will build and start the containers, and execute `composer install` in the `workspace` container. So basically you are done üòÅ

## Upgrade

To upgrade your project against the laravel-blueprint, you can run the following command.

```
