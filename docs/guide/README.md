## Installation

To start a new project based on this repository, you should do a fork of it. So for the following, you will have to replace the repository url `git@github.com:tjventurini/laravel-blueprint.git` with your own.

To install this blueprint you need to clone this repository.

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:tjventurini/laravel-blueprint.git
```

Then you should go ahead and update the laradock configuration in your project in `.env.docker.example`. Make sure to update the `DATA_PATH_HOST` and `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` environment variables. Also you will have to set the `UID`s and `GID`s that match your host systems. You can find them out by running `id -a`.

Also make sure to update the `Makefile` of this project. You might need to update the `CONTAINERS` variable at the top of the file to specify the list of containers that you want to start for your project.

```
########################################
# variables
CONTAINERS=nginx php-fpm mysql workspace
```

Now you are ready to execute the setup from the make file.

```
make init
```

This will build and start the containers, and execute `composer install` in the `workspace` container. So basically you are done üòÅ
